Work Distribution:
- Our team aims for equal contribution
- To achieve that, we may need to assist each other frequently to ensure all teammates are on the same page

Communication:
- Our team aims to hold Zoom meetings at least once a week
- Lab hours are often used to discuss goals and distribute tasks
- Meetings are used to combine and finalize work, so group members are expected to have finished their designated part of work
- Absence needs to be communicated to the rest of the groupmate beforehand, and one should strive to catch up with the discussion in his own time

Workload:
- Regular, recurrent meetings are expected to take at least 30-60 minutes
- We are expected to work extra hours outside of our discussions in order to finish our own designated parts
- In case one feels overwhelming, communicate immediately with the rest of the team to ensure workloads are distributed fairly

Quality:
- Our team strives for the best work possible in our capacity, while balancing the other courses and our well-being
- Note that our top priority is not the grades, but that we learn throughout the process, and have fun learning :)
- When parts of the project received deducted marks, whole team is responsible instead of the persons that are in charge of that area

Ethics:
- Absolutely no room for plagiarism in this group
- Always cite sources and references when needed
- Be honest and direct with each other
- Be humble and open-minded as every group memberâ€™s opinion matters
