# Rainfall Analysis - 525 Group 22
In Milestone 1, we will explore different methods to load, save and transform large datasets.

## Usage

For easiest readability, please view the notebook as a webpage [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/rainfall_group22/), or download and open the raw [html](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rainfall_group22/blob/main/notebooks/milestone1.html).

This notebook is to be run in the 525 conda environment. I experienced some issues with `r2py`, but was able to solve them by adding `python=3.8.6` to the yaml file and recreate the environment.

We have used some helper functions, so before running please make sure to clone the repo: [https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rainfall_group22](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rainfall_group22).
